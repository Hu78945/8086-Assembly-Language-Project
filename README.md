# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in assembly language. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol ('x' or 'o') to win the game.

## Requirements

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you need:

- An x86-compatible computer system
- An assembler and linker capable of assembling and linking assembly code
- An environment that supports executing the resulting executable file

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Assemble and link the assembly code using the appropriate assembler and linker. For example, if you're using NASM assembler and GCC linker, you can use the following commands:

# shell

nasm -f elf tic_tac_toe.asm -o tic_tac_toe.o
gcc -m32 tic_tac_toe.o -o tic_tac_toe

3. Execute the resulting executable file:

# shell

./tic_tac_toe

4. Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to play the game. Enter the row and column numbers to mark your position on the game board.

## Implementation Details

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is implemented in assembly language, specifically x86 assembly. The program utilizes subroutines and a game loop to manage the game's flow and logic. The game board is represented using an array of memory addresses, where each position corresponds to a specific cell in the grid.

The program checks for win conditions by examining rows, columns, and diagonals on the game board. It keeps track of the current player, validates user input, and displays the game board after each move. The game continues until a win condition is met or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
